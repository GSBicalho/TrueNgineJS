# TrueNgineJS
A quick and dirty port of [TrueNgine](https://github.com/GSBicalho/TrueNgine) to javascript

Documentation and explanation of the project and its purpose can be found in the link above, in the original project's repo. I created this because a Javascript site is easier to access and deploy than an uncompiled C++ program. However, if the intent is to understand what is happening, I'd still recommend the original, as it has types (and Eigen is a far better matrix library than math.js)

There are currently a couple of kinks (such as face renderization not working) and other problems (such as the code being extremely weird because it was an almost line by line translation from C++) but it works well enough.

Files with politopes to vizualise can be found on the original repo too.

Just dowload the repo and open index.html and everything should work.
